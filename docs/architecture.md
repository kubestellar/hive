# Architecture

## Two scheduling models

supervised-agent supports two fundamentally different ways to drive an agent. Choose based on how much control you want to keep.

### Model A — Self-scheduling (/loop cron)

The agent registers its own cron job (`/loop 15m …`) and fires on that cadence indefinitely. The supervisor's only job is to keep the session alive and respawn it if it crashes. Low operator involvement; the agent runs autonomously.

**Best for:** Single-agent setups, batch jobs, anything where the cadence is fixed and you trust the agent to stay on task.

### Model B — EXECUTOR MODE (supervisor-driven)

The agent starts, reads its policy, then **waits at the prompt** for the supervisor to send work orders via `tmux send-keys`. No cron, no self-scheduling. The supervisor (another Claude Code session, a script, or a human) decides when to fire and what to do.

**Best for:** Multi-agent setups where you want a single controller to prioritize across several agents, production workflows where you need to inspect output before triggering the next step, or any situation where the agent kept re-starting its own loop despite being told not to.

> **Gotcha — session restore bakes in old crons.** Claude Code restores its previous conversation context on respawn. If the agent ever registered a `/loop` cron before, that cron comes back in the restored context even if the new `AGENT_LOOP_PROMPT` says not to. The fix: after sending the startup prompt, send a second message ~30 seconds later that says "CronList — delete every cron job you find." The [`scanner-supervisor.sh`](../systemd/scanner-supervisor.sh.example) reference implementation does this automatically via a background `send_cron_nuke` call.

> **Gotcha — tmux `-l` makes Enter literal.** When dispatching work orders, always split text and Enter into **two separate** `tmux send-keys` calls:
> ```sh
> tmux send-keys -t session -l "do the thing"
> sleep 1
> tmux send-keys -t session Enter
> ```
> Combining them as `tmux send-keys -t session -l "do the thing" Enter` sends the word "Enter" as part of the literal text, leaving the agent stuck with text in its input box.

## Four components, four failure modes

| # | Unit | Trigger | Catches |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `supervised-agent.service` | Always running; internal poll every `AGENT_POLL_SEC` (default 10s) | Agent process crash, tmux session killed, TUI-ready detection for startup prompt injection, auto-approval of a known sensitive-file prompt |
| 2 | `supervised-agent-renew.timer` | Every 6 days + 5 min after boot | Claude Code `/loop` cron auto-expires at 7 days — kills the session so the supervisor re-registers a fresh one. **Disable this in EXECUTOR MODE** — there is no cron to renew. |
| 3 | `supervised-agent-healthcheck.timer` | Every 20 min + 5 min after boot | Agent is "alive" but not making progress (auth loop, stuck prompt, model stuck thinking) — watches heartbeat-file mtime |
| 4 | ntfy push inside the healthcheck | On stall, on recovery, on escalation | Operator not watching the box — phone push |

## Reactions to each failure mode

### Model A (self-scheduling)

    participant A as agent
    participant L as heartbeat.log
    participant R as renew.timer

    Note over S,T: boot-time / first run

    S->>T: wait for AGENT_READY_MARKER
    S->>A: send AGENT_LOOP_PROMPT (/loop 15m …)

    loop every 15m (agent's own cron)

    Note over R: every 6d
    R->>T: kill-session
    S->>T: new-session (fresh /loop, new 7d TTL)

    Note over H: every 20m
    H->>L: stat mtime
    alt mtime fresh (age ≤ AGENT_STALE_MAX_SEC)
        H->>N: (if was stale) "recovered"

        S->>T: new-session

    end

    Note over H: after AGENT_MAX_RESPAWNS failed attempts
    H->>N: "manual intervention needed"
    H->>H: stop auto-respawning until recovery
```

### Model B (EXECUTOR MODE)

```mermaid

    autonumber
    participant Op as operator / supervisor session
    participant S as supervisor service
    participant T as tmux session
    participant A as agent
    participant H as healthcheck.timer
    participant N as ntfy.sh

    Note over S,T: boot-time / crash recovery
    S->>T: new-session
    T->>A: spawn agent
    S->>T: wait for AGENT_READY_MARKER
    S->>A: send EXECUTOR startup prompt (no /loop)
    S->>A: (30s later) CronList — delete every cron
    A->>A: reads policy, reports status, waits

    loop operator-driven
        Op->>T: tmux send-keys -l "work order text"
        Op->>T: tmux send-keys Enter
        A->>A: execute work order
        A->>Op: (visible in pane) result summary
    end

    Note over H: every 20m
    H->>H: stat heartbeat mtime (agent writes on each work order)
    alt mtime stale
        H->>T: kill-session
        S->>T: new-session (EXECUTOR startup, cron nuke)
        H->>N: "stalled, respawning"
    end
```

## Multi-agent topology

When running several agents on the same machine, the EXECUTOR pattern lets a single supervisor session coordinate all of them without the agents conflicting:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   supervisor session (Mac)          │
│   /loop — sweeps every 20-25 min    │
│   sends tmux work orders to agents  │
└──────┬──────────┬──────────┬────────┘
       │          │          │
       ▼          ▼          ▼
  scanner      reviewer   outreach
  (Opus 4.7)  (Sonnet)   (Sonnet)
  claude-dev   claude-dev  claude-dev
  tmux         tmux        tmux
```

Each agent:
- Has its own tmux session and systemd service
- Reads its own policy file from the shared memory directory
- Writes to a shared work ledger (`bd` / beads) using `--actor <name>` to claim work
- Skips items already claimed by another actor (`bd list --actor=<other> --status=in_progress`)
- Notifies the operator via ntfy for decisions that require human judgment

Renew timers are **disabled** for all agents in EXECUTOR MODE. The supervisor sends a fresh startup + cron-nuke on every respawn automatically.

## What this deliberately does NOT handle

- **Remote box offline / network partition.** If the whole machine is down, there's no process left to push a stall alert. A secondary watcher outside the box (uptimerobot, healthchecks.io, your laptop) is the correct answer, and is out of scope for this repo.
- **ntfy.sh downtime.** Free tier, rare, tolerable. Self-host or swap the transport if you need SLAs.
- **Agent logic bugs.** If the agent decides to do nothing forever but remembers to write the heartbeat, the healthcheck won't catch it. The log format in your policy file should include non-trivial counts (repos scanned, actions taken) so you can spot a "no-op loop" visually.
- **Secrets management.** Don't put credentials in `agent.env`. The agent should source them from its own credential store (`~/.claude/.credentials.json` for Claude Code, vault / secrets manager for anything else).
